# Pre-study and project features

## Tasks distribution for pre-study

- List potential APIs that could be used to retreive the data and the possible format of data these APIs are using
- Make some research about the different ways to store and index a huge amount of data and highlight the ones that can match our needs
- State of art
- Think about how the download of the data will be processed and politics to handle any kind of error
- Find any possible application tasks that could be made parallel or distributed
- Define useful tags that will be used to filter the stored data (tags provided by the APIs or built from data with libraries)
- Browse libraries that could be useful for our project problematic and compare them to chose the best language

## Global vision of the project

The project will enable a user to create data set used for data learning. The application will download media files (such as text, image, video, audio...) from APIs, store and index them so that we can find them back easier. The user will be able to filter the data with some provided tags to personalize his data set.
